This file describes the contents of this project repo:

1) README - this file (merely a table of contents)

2) Makefile - tool created to enable the compilation of charType.c, provide easy analysis for
   memory usage and allocation via "memcheck" (usage: "make memcheck"), and allow the user to
   easily clean the directory of object files or in/out files.

3) charType.c - Reads all characters from an input file and checks for the number of
   alphabetical, numerical, punctuation, and whitespace characters, separates
   them, then prints the results in an output file in order the order of:
   (1) line number; (2) alphabetical characters on that line; (3) numerical
   characters on that line; (4) punctuation characters on that line;
   (5) whitespace characters on that line.

4) in.txt - an example of an input file

5) out.txt - the corresponding output file, generated by executing the program using the latter
   input file (in.txt above)
